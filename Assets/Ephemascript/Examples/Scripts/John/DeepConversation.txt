An NPC\ Well!

This is in fact a conversation that is in a different text file.

And therefore a different state.

So you can nest conversations into eachother.

That's pretty cool

you can also access vars with ExtVar, etc.

You can also end the whole conversation depending on which type of @end you use.

Do you want to end the conversation?
Yup\ENDCONV
No\DONTENDCONV

@ENDCONV:
@end all

@DONTENDCONV:
@end
